**Project Idea:** For students who are looking for off-campus
housing, **PropHunt** is a review site that allows users to post
and view reviews about rental properties. Unlike other typical
rental review apps, our product is geared towards the unique
challenges faced by student-tenants, such as regular turnover,
studying abroad, and campus proximity.

Similar to PolyProfile, rate your professor but for your
property. Customers can view properties and the property
management company/landlord associated with the property.
Customers can leave reviews and view reviews.

**Authentication Implementation:**
