**Project Idea:**
For students who are looking for off-campus housing, **PropHunt** is a review site that allows users to post and view reviews about rental properties. Unlike other typical rental review apps, our product is geared towards the unique challenges faced by student-tenants, such as regular turnover, studying abroad, and campus proximity.

Similar to PolyProfile, rate your professor but for your property. Customers can view properties and the property management company/landlord  associated with the property. Customers can leave reviews and view reviews.
