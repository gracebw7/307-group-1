**Project Idea: ** Rate Your Landlord

For students who are looking for off-campus housing, Prop Hunt is a review site that allows users to post and view reviews about rental properties. Unlike other typical rental review apps, our product is geared towards the unique challenges faced by student-tenets, such as regular turnover, studying abroad, and campus proximity.

Similar to PolyProfile, rate your professor but for your landlord. Customers can view property management companies and the landlords/properties associated with the company. Customers can leave reviews and view reviews.
